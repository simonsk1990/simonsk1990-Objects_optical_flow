def GettingLiveRoi(): - I used mouse events EVENT_LBUTTONDOWN
to stop frame, would suggest using ord('c') for charecter rather
then mouse event

def colorMovemet() workaround to object direction tracking.
Tried various methods including math.ata2() for alpha,
Dense Optical Flow inside roi to track color movement,
none with ok result, tracking 4 pixles direction gave ok
result.
Would suggest adding more directions.
